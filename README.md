## Introduction

With the growing popularity of widgets on both Android and iOS platforms, it's essential for developers to know how to create these efficiently using the tools at their disposal. This study case explores the process of creating widgets with Expo in a React Native environment.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Expo CLI](https://expo.dev/tools/cli)
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- A mobile device/emulator with either Android or iOS.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ImBIOS/RNWidget.git
cd RNWidget
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
bun install
```

3. **Start the Expo Development Server**

```bash
bun run start # expo start
```

This will open a new window in your default browser displaying a QR code. Scan this code using the Expo Go app on your mobile device or use an emulator.
